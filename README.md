Hi everyone, I'm Hieu-J!
With three years of experience studying and exploring Information Technology, I'm particularly passionate about computer networks, web structures, and application design.
I actively seek opportunities to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world projects.
I'm eager to collaborate online with like-minded individuals to learn and grow together.
Contact me at: hieutrung030805@gmail.com
Fun fact: I enjoy challenging myself with system performance optimization problems.
